This is a collection of reports I've written as a part of my coursework at PSU. 
They're all over 4 pages, so you probably don't want to read them all.
But, if you look through a couple pages of each, you'll get a good idea of the kind of report I'm used to creating. 
Of course, if you specialize in one of their subjects, I'd love if you took a look at it. 

My typical workflow is 
* Initial reading and research
* Calculations by hand and/or using R
* Write the document in LaTeX as mostly plain text. If I've done a decent amount of work in R, I write a Knitr document around the existing R script. 
* Create any diagrams using GIMP/Inkscape/Dia.
* Tweak all equations and plots to my liking.

## Plateau-Rayleigh Instability in a Lava Lamp
This is a look at how the instability of the surface of a free fluid cylinder is affected by flow of the fluid relative to the boundaries.
Specifically, I try to find an explanation for why lava lamps seem to enter a phase where the wax forms a column which "should" be unstable.

I go over a tounge-in-cheek approximation for how to estimate the aspect ratio at which a fluid cylinder is unstable. 
Then, I mirror Lord Rayleigh's original paper on the topic in semi-detail.
I look at the non-dimensional parameters of the system and a few tangible explanations of why the instability occurs.

Finally, I attempt to adapt Rayleigh's approach to the lava lamp and immediately run into some pretty difficult differential equation problems. 
I might be able to solve it with a lot more time and experience, but for the purposes of the report it was enough to make my own tounge-in-cheek derivation for what the neck radius of the wax column should be.
I get it within an order of magnitude.

## Developing a Reproducible Sonoluminescence Procedure
Spoilers: I couldn't make a reproducible procedure for generating sonoluminescence.
This paper was a guide of what not to do, an overview of the theory, and some stuff that seemed to work.
I couldn't even get the effect to occur once. It was really an excercise in how to deal with failure.

Sonoluminescence is
