[Launch Vehicle 3][repo] (LV3) is a project I'm working on for the [Portland State Aerospace Society][psas] (PSAS). 
I'm bulding a complete rocket airframe out of carbon fiber. 
This replaces their previous launch vehicle, LV2, reducing the overall weight by a factor of 5 while increasing the outer diameter from 5.5 to 6.6 inches.
LV3 will serve as a test platform for the technologies PSAS will use in their 100 km sounding rocket. 

I direct all the subprojects of the airframe, working with a wide range of people, from sophomore mechanical engineers to long-time professional electrical engineers. 
However, most of my time has been spent manufacturing airframe modules and documenting those processes.

If you'd like to read more about the project, I published [a conference paper on it][paperCopy] in [the proceedings of AIAA SPACE 2016][citation]. 
There's also [the project's GidHub repository][repo] which contains all of the CAD, testing, documentation, and design work for the project.
