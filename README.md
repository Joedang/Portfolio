# Portfolio
My most interesting work can be found by [looking at the repositories I contribute to most](https://github.com/Joedang).
This is a collection of work I've done that I think is worth seeing, but isn't associated with any repository.
Feel free to check out the READMEs in the various directories for a more mid-length explanation of everything.

## Programming
I've included some simulations I've written looking at [the restricted version of the 3-body problem](https://github.com/Joedang/restricted_three_body_problem) in R, some [N-body and general simulation stuff](MATLAB_orbits/) in MATLAB, and a [realistic simulation of short-range projectile motion](projectile/) accounting for buoyancy, drag, centrifugal, and Coriolis effects. 
I also wrote a handful of interesting Bash and Python scripts in my [dotfiles](http://github.com/Joedang/dotfiles) repo.

## Thermal/Fluids Engineering
I wrote a few class reports in this field:
* [Using the Plateau-Rayleigh instability to explain real-world phenomena.](ClassReports/LavaPRinstability_V1-3.pdf)
* [Attempting to implement a desktop sonoluminescence demonstration.](ClassReports/SL_report_Shields_V1-2.pdf)
* [Calculating the temperature of the Earth based on a single-layer model of the atmosphere.](ClassReports/Shields_ME442_TakeHome2.pdf)

## Manufacturing/Materials Engineering
I "only" have the [LV3](LV3/) project for this. You can check out the [AIAA SPACE conference paper](LV3/LV3_AIAA.pdf) I wrote or [the repo for the project](http://github.com/psas/lv3.0-airframe).

## Miscellaneous
* [Detailed explanation of every step of the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paper on the apparent incompleteness of quantum mechanics.](ClassReports/Shields_EPR_project_V1-1.pdf)
* [Explanation of vibrating beams using Euler and Timoshenko bending models.](ClassReports/viscoFinalReport_Shields_Chen_Schmidt.pdf) (I wrote the section on the vibration of Euler beams.)
